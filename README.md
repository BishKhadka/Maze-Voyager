# Maze Voyager
Maze Voyager is a Java program designed to navigate through dynamically generated mazes and discover a path from the starting point to the designated target.

## Details

🗺️ Dynamic Mazes: The mazes are dynamically generated and the algorithm adjusts to these unpredictable variations.

🎨 Pathfinding: The maze and the process of pathfinding are displayed using Java Graphics. 

🛤️ Solution Path: The program implements a depth-first search to establish a solution path.

🧭 Shortest Path: The program accurately determines the shortest route from the start to the target using breadth-first search.


## Guidelines for Program Execution
#### On your terminal:

🔧 Compile:

      javac *.java

#### For a solution:

🚀 Run:

      java GridSearch anypath

#### For the shortest path:

🚀 Run

      java GridSearch shortestpath
